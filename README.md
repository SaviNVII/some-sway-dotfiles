# Overview
Some basic personal sway dotfiles

Most of this was made by my friend lmao, you can find their original dotfiles [here](https://github.com/protogenposting/sway-dotfiles)

# Features
- Binds for saving replay buffers and toggling recording in obs (Super+Shift+Z and Super+Shift+X)
- Screenshot bind (Super+Shift+S)
- Custom playlist tool, add playlists and play them through commandline! (Super+Shift+P)

# Install
First, run the `install.sh` script to install all the dependancies (assumes you are on arch and have yay installed already. If not, manually installing the packages works too!)

Then copy all the files here into ~/.config/sway

And... that's it! Have fun!
